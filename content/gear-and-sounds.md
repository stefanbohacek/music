My current setup primarily consists of:

- [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) as my main working environment.
- I don’t have a dedicated studio, and often compose at night, so I use a pair of [Audio-Technica ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-m50x) headphones.
- [Akai MPK Mini mk3](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mk3): A gift from my wife for my 33rd birthday that kicked off my music production journey. This is a nice, compact MIDI keyboard, great for writing melodies and making beats.
- [M-Audio Keystation 49](https://www.m-audio.com/products/view/keystation-49): My space for playing is a bit limited, so I wanted something with a wider range than the MPK Mini that’s still small enough to fit on a desk.
- [Akai MIDImix](https://www.akaipro.com/midimix): A MIDI [control surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_control_surface) with a good amount of knobs and sliders. Typically you’d use this to control your DAW, but I wanted a way to make it easier to adjust parameters of virtual synths.
- [Arturia’s V Collection](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/v-collection/overview#en): You’d have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to get all of the original synths, if you could get your hands on them at all. I have some cheaper and free synths as well, but I like that Arturia recreates the original circuits instead of just using samples, and in some cases they even [get the original creators involved](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/mini-v/overview). I also recommend watching [these detailed overviews of some of Arturia’s instruments](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JLtclHvZbfZTfBoo-6uug/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5).
- Instrument libraries from [Spitfire Audio](https://spitfireaudio.com/).
- Instruments and effects from [Output](https://output.com/).
- Unique and free instruments from [Pianobook](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/).
- And [Splice](https://splice.com/) is my go-to place for samples and loops.
